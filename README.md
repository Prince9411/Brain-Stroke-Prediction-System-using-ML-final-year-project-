# 🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke in a patient based on various health parameters. It was developed as part of a final year academic project to demonstrate the real-world application of data science and machine learning in the healthcare sector.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts the risk of brain stroke based on patient data
- Clean and preprocessed dataset
- Multiple ML algorithms evaluated (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Model performance comparison and visualization
- User-friendly interface for data input and prediction

## 📊 Dataset

The model uses the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle. It includes the following features:

- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Ever Married
- Work Type
- Residence Type
- Average Glucose Level
- BMI
- Smoking Status

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (or Flask) for frontend (if used)
- Jupyter Notebook (for training and analysis)
